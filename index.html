                scene. She has enjoyed traveling to many faraway places to share her unique Hardcore music style

                mainstream.

                20 in the Shejay Top 100 International Female DJs poll in 2006, and top 10 in Europe‚Äôs Core

                energetic stage presence, she's achieved trail-blazing success and continues to open minds at every
                performance. Her vast musical interests and broad spectrum of taste are the driving forces behind
                her DJ approach, making every set fun and unpredictable. She'll mix the best tracks from yesterday
                and today along with original edits, refixes, and productions. She's produced several unreleased
                Hardcore tracks with good friend DJ How Hard, one was featured on a worldwide charity
                compilation on Hardcodelia Records in 2020.
                In 2021, Jen relaunched Vitus to showcase her family of talented musicians and artists via
                livestream and in-person events. Her goal has always been to share positive energy with others
                through music, good vibes, camaraderie, and sisterhood. Music is a universal language that will
                always bring people together, which we need now more than ever!
